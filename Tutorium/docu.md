E = This programm takes 2 inputs from the user (a, b) 
V = We use those values to calculate the arit und the harmis with these formel $2\cdot a$ and $7\cdot 1$
O = Print in the console arit, harm of the two given values

* Documentation should always be based on the EVA-principle. These is just a small example. 
* Example/Test can be shown here or inside the code as a comment
    * Be sure is clear in the test what the _Eingabe_ is, what is expected to happen and the _Ausgabe_ (what actually came out). For small programs is simple and obvious what will come out but later on, with bigger programs is not always as easy and for that reason when the _Ausgabe_ is not the expected value has to be documented. (In case the error is not found)
