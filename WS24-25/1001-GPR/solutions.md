### Task 1
1. What is typing? What kind of typing does Python use, and how does this differ from other programming languages?

Typing in programming languages restricts the range and type of variable values. Typing is categorized into strong and weak typing. Python is strongly typed but differs from other languages in that type determination only occurs at runtime. Other or additional aspects may also be mentioned.

2. What is the difference between a compiled and an interpreted programming language?

Compiled: The compiler creates the machine code entirely before the program's runtime.
Interpreted: The interpreter generates the machine code during the program's runtime.

3. What is the difference between a bit and a byte?

Bit: 2 values (true or false); Byte: a sequence of 8 bits.

4. Explain the IPO principle (Input-Process-Output). Provide the meaning and a brief explanation.

Input: Consider what inputs the program needs.
Process: Process the data that is read through input or from storage.
Output: Output to the user through various media.

### Task 2

* TypeError: This error occurs when a function or operator is used with the wrong data type. For example, trying to add a string to an integer will raise a TypeError.

* IndexError: This error is raised when an index is outside the range of a sequence or object. For example, attempting to access an element at an index that is larger than the length of a list will result in an IndexError.

* SyntaxError: This error occurs when the code contains invalid syntax according to the Python language rules. The parser does not recognize the syntax as valid Python.

* MemoryError: This error is raised when Python cannot allocate enough memory to complete an operation. It usually happens when attempting to process large datasets or objects that exceed available memory.
